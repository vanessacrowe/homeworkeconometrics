## Regression Modelingby Wages in R

For this lab we will be looking into people at prime age in the labor force who work fulltime, year round according to NYs ACS data from 2017. We will call this subset "data_use"


```{r}
load("Desktop/Econometrics R Projects/acs2017_ny_data.RData")

use_var <- (acs2017_ny$AGE >= 25) & (acs2017_ny$AGE <= 55) & (acs2017_ny$LABFORCE == 2) & (acs2017_ny$WKSWORK2 > 4) & (acs2017_ny$UHRSWORK >= 35)
data_use <- subset(acs2017_ny,use_var) 
```

We then model this subset into a Linear regression of Income Wage against Age with additional arguments of race and education

```{r}
model_temp1 <- lm(INCWAGE ~ AGE + AfAm + Asian + Amindian + race_oth + Hispanic + educ_hs + educ_somecoll + educ_college + educ_advdeg, data = data_use)

require(stargazer)
stargazer(model_temp1, type = "text")
```
The above shows that almost all races have a significant relationship to income as age increases. With all races but Asian's having a negative correlation
However, income is showing to increase significantly as the level of education increases 

Below we are now creating a random subset of the data in Income and selecting 10% of these observations. It will create a cleaner visualization when plotted. 

We are creating a scatter plot with a jitter affect of 1 to give "noise" to the income values at each age so we can see less overlapping of data values. 

There were also a set of outliers with significantly high income that is off the charts, we therefor have set a limit of 150k to our plot.

```{r}
require(AER)

NNobs <- length(data_use$INCWAGE)
set.seed(12345) 
graph_obs <- (runif(NNobs) < 0.1) 
dat_graph <-subset(data_use,graph_obs)  

plot(INCWAGE ~ jitter(AGE, factor = 1), pch = 16, col = rgb(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, alpha = 0.2), ylim = c(0,150000), data = dat_graph)
title(main = "Income Salary by Age", col.main = "blue")


to_be_predicted2 <- data.frame(AGE = 25:55, AfAm = 0, Asian = 0, Amindian = 1, race_oth = 1, Hispanic = 1, educ_hs = 0, educ_somecoll = 0, educ_college = 1, educ_advdeg = 0)

to_be_predicted2$yhat <- predict(model_temp1, newdata = to_be_predicted2)

lines(yhat ~ AGE, data = to_be_predicted2)

```
In Scatter plot "Income Salary by Age" we proceeded to create predicted values of Income based on age and certain races such as Amindian = 1, race_oth = 1, Hispanic = 1 as well as educ_college = 1 to create a line called Yhat
This line shows that the values of income range between about 49099 and 88373, shown by the min and max of the below summary

```{r}
summary(to_be_predicted2$yhat)
```
